## Prerequisites

To get started with using ARCtrl, we first need to make sure some prerequisites are met. 
What these are depends on the programming language you are going to program in. 

In any of the three cases, there are of course a plethora of different ways to setup your environment. These are therefore only suggestions to get started. 



## Installation

Now you can install the `ARCtrl` package.

<Tabs syncKey="pl">

{/* FSHARP */}
<TabItem label="FSharp" icon='seti:'>

You can find the .NET package on nuget: 

<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/ARCtrl/"><img alt="Nuget" src="https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/ARCtrl?logo=nuget&color=%234fb3d9"/></a>

For .NET projects, you can just run

```shell
dotnet add package ARCtrl
```

For working in a script, you can easily reference the ARCtrl package from nuget. 

```fsharp
#r "nuget: ARCtrl"

open ARCtrl
```
</TabItem>



{/* JAVASCRIPT */}
<TabItem label="Javascript" icon='seti:javascript'>

You can find the Javascript package on npm: 

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nfdi4plants/arctrl"><img alt="NPM" src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40nfdi4plants/arctrl?logo=npm&color=%234fb3d9"/></a>

To install in your module, just run

```shell
npm install @nfdi4plants/arctrl
```

You can now import the main `ARC` class in your `js` source file

```js
import {ARC} from "@nfdi4plants/arctrl";
```
</TabItem>


{/* PYTHON */}
<TabItem label="Python" icon='seti:python'>


You can find the Python package on PyPI: 

<a href="https://pypi.org/project/ARCtrl/"><img alt="PyPI" src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/arctrl?logo=pypi&color=%234fb3d9"/></a>

To install in your environment, just run

```shell
pip install arctrl
```


You can now import the main `ARC` class in your `py` source file

```py
from arctrl.arc import ARC
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
