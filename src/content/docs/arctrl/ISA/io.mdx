`ARCtrl` is a software library for working with ARCs. 
By transpilation from the `F#` source code, it is not only hosted on nuget, but also as a javascript package on npm and as a python package on pypi.

You can find the .NET package on nuget: 

<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/ARCtrl/"><img alt="Nuget" src="https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/ARCtrl?logo=nuget&color=%234fb3d9"/></a>

For .NET projects, you can just run

```shell
dotnet add package ARCtrl
```

For working in a script, you can easily reference the ARCtrl package from nuget. 

```fsharp
#r "nuget: ARCtrl"

open ARCtrl
```
</TabItem>

To install in your module, just run

```shell
