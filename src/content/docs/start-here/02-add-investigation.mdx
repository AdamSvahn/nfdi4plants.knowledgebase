The ISA investigation workbook allows you to record administrative metadata of your project. 

In Viola's example, the title of the project, the contact persons, and related publications correspond to such metadata. Besides that, the workbook can also contain a short description of your project, but also lists included studies with respective design types, assays, protocols, etc..


```bash

## Investigation identifier
- Use a short acronym without blanks
- Avoid administrative metadata (name, data, etc.)
## Use a combination of keywords maybe grant number
- Title
Meaningful project title (with blanks)
Avoid administrative metadata
Description
Concise project abstract 
Contacts
Person responsible for the project 
```
