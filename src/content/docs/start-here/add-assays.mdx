## Assays

The `assays` folder allows you to store data and metadata from experimental processes or analytical measurements. Each assay is a collection of files stored in a single directory, including corresponding metadata files in form of an `isa.assay.xlsx`. Viola needs two subdirectories, one for her metabolomics and one for her transcriptomics dataset, respectively. Assay data files and free-text protocols are placed in individual subdirectories. Data files produced by an assay can be the input for one or multiple [workflows](#workflows).

### isa.assay.xlsx

Viola can annotate her experimental workflows of the metabolomics and transcriptomics assays with process parameters in the `isa.assay.xlsx` file, which needs to be present for every assay. The workbook contains two or more worksheets, depending on the number of used protocols:

- "MetaboliteExtraction": A worksheet to annotate the experimental workflow, in this case for extraction of metabolites. While this can be done manually, we recommend using our ontology supported annotation tool [Swate][kb-swate_QuickStart].
> Note: Using the name of the protocol for the name of the worksheet can provide clarity. 
- "MetaboliteMeasurement": A worksheet that describes the quantification of polar metabolites using gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry.
- "Assay": Viola collected the administrative metadata of her assay in this worksheet. This information can later be transferred into the `isa.investigation.xlsx` using the ARC Commander.
