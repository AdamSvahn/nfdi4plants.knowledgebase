## The ARC Scaffold

![](@images/start-here/arc-scaffold.svg)


## Everything is a file

import NewARC from '@components/mdx/NewARC.mdx'

<NewARC />

An ARC represents an entire investigation. At the top level, it includes directories named “studies,” “assays,” “workflows,” and “runs,” along with an investigation metadata table that holds all administrative metadata.

## Create a new ARC using ARCitect

The easiest way to create a new ARC is via ARCitect.

<Card title="ARCitect installation">

If ARCitect is not yet installed on your computer, 

<details>
<summary>please follow these instructions to install ARCitect</summary>

import ARCitectInstallation from '../arcitect/installation.mdx'

<ARCitectInstallation />

</details>

</Card>

<Steps>

1. Start the **ARCitect** app
2. In the sidebar on the left, click on `New ARC`
3. Select a location and name for your ARC

</Steps>

<Card title="Your ARC's name">

By default, your ARC's name will be used:

1. for the ARC folder on your computer
2. as the identifier for your investigation

:::tip
- Use a short acronym  
- Avoid spaces and special characters in your ARC's name
- Avoid administrative metadata (name, data, etc.)
- Use a combination of keywords maybe grant number

<ViolaSays>

To keep it simple, I call my ARC "AthalianaSugarClock"
