An ARC represents an entire investigation. At the top level, it includes directories named “studies,” “assays,” “workflows,” and “runs,” along with an investigation metadata table that holds all administrative metadata.

{/* ## Create a new ARC */}

The easiest way to create a new ARC is via **ARCitect**.

<Steps>

1. Start the **ARCitect** app
2. In the sidebar on the left, click on `New ARC`
3. Select a location and name for your ARC

    <ViolaSays>

    To keep it simple, I call my ARC "AthalianaColdStressSugar"

    </ViolaSays>

4. Click `Save`
5. ARCitect creates the base ARC folder on your computer and opens it right away
  
    <FileTree>
    
    - AthalianaColdStressSugar
      - **studies**
      - **assays**
      - **workflows**
      - **runs**
      - isa.investigation.xlsx
    
    </FileTree>

    :::note
    The `isa.investigation.xlsx` is not displayed inside ARCitect.

<Card title="Your ARC's name" icon="approve-check" >

By default, your ARC's name will be used:

1. for the ARC folder on your computer
2. as the **investigation identifier** 

:::tip
- Use a short acronym  
- Avoid spaces and special characters in your ARC's name
- Avoid administrative metadata (name, data, etc.)
- Use a combination of keywords maybe grant number
