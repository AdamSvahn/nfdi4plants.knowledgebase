In `studies` you can collect material and resources used within your studies.

<ViolaSays>

- the source of my seeds (South-African Botanical Society)
- how I grew the plants
- the design of my experiment (two-day time series, etc.)

In case your investigation contains more than one study, each of these studies is placed in an individual subdirectory. The "resources" directory allows you to store material samples or external data as virtual sample files. 



{/* Every study contains one `isa.study.xlsx` file to specify the characteristics of all material and resources. Resources described in a study file can be the input for one or multiple assays or workflows. The workbook contains (at least) two worksheets:

- "CircadianClock_Light regimes": One or more worksheets, depending on the number of used protocols, to annotate the properties of your source material following the ISA model. The sheet name is not obligatory to be the exact same as the "Study Identifier".

## Protocols

You can use the protocol subdirectory to store free-text protocols that describe how the samples or materials were created.

## Referencing the protocol

:::tip
While it is recommended to store the protocol in an open format (`.md`, `.txt`, `.docx`, â€¦), everything is possible also an URI to an electronic lab notebook.
