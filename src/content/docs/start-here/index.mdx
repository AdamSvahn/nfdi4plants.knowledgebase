Welcome to the DataPLANT "Getting Started" to create your own ARC's!

ARCs are structured data containers that help you to organize your research data in a standardized way. They are based on existing standards, unifying machine and human readability!

Starting out with ARCs can be a bit overwhelming, but don't worry! We are here to help you with the first steps. This guide will walk you through the process of creating your first ARC, adding data to it, and uploading it to the DataHub.

Together we will follow a fictional researcher **Viola** on her journey to create her first ARC. Viola is a plant scientist and has heard about ARCs and wants to give them a try.

## ARC structure 

Let's follow Viola, our fictional plant scientist, who recently attended a conference where her project partner introduced her to the Annotated Research Context (ARC). Intrigued by the promise, Viola is eager to set up her first ARC upon returning to her lab. However, once back, she only recalls the basic ARC structure and something about some isa.xlsx files. 

A basic ARC consists of the following components:

import BaseArc from '@components/mdx/BaseARC.mdx'

<BaseArc />

Note the four main folder types: `studies`, `assays`, `workflows`, and `runs`. Each of these folders contains specific information about the project, its studies, assays, and workflows.
