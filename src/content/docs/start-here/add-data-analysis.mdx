How will Viola transfer her project into ARC structure?

## Workflows

In an ARC `workflows` represent the processing steps used in computational analyses and other transformations of data originating from studies and assays. Typical examples include data cleaning and preprocessing, computational analysis, or visualization. The outcomes of these workflows ("run results") are stored in [runs](#runs).

Viola received for her transcriptome and metabolome assays various processed data files, which she now can use to generate some nice plots. Additionally, the computational biologists sent her the code used for data processing, including an executable Common Workflow Language (CWL) file, which contains a standardized tool or workflow description. She stores these files in individual subdirectories for each workflow.

## Runs

After Viola generated her plots, she placed them in individual subdirectories, specific to the run they were generated with. In general, you can use the runs folder to store plots, tables, or similar result files that derive from computations on study, assay, external data or other runs.
