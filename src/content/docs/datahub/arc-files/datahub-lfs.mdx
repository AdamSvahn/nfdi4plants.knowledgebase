Open your ARC in the DataHUB and navigate to the folder with LFS objects. Files uploaded with LFS are flagged as "LFS" (1).

## Checking usage quota of LFS

If at some point you would like to check the storage used by your ARC, you can easily do so by navigating to your ARC in the DataHUB and clicking on "Project Storage" in the right sidebar (1).
