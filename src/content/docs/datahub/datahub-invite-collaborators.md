## About this guide

In this guide we show you how to invite lab colleagues or project partners to your ARC for collaboration. 

## Before we can start

:ballot_box_with_check: You have a [DataPLANT account](https://register.nfdi4plants.org)
:ballot_box_with_check: You have created an ARC  
:bulb: Unless changed, your ARC is set to private by default.

## Inviting collaborators

1. [Sign in](https://auth.nfdi4plants.org/realms/dataplant/login-actions/registration?client_id=account&tab_id=4bQkU161waI) to the DataHUB and open the ARC you want to share.
2. Click on **Manage** in the left navigation panel

## Choosing the proper role

#### Guests

Have the least rights. They will not be able to see the content of your ARC (only the wiki page).

#### Reporters

Have **read access** to your ARC. This is recommended for people you ask for consultancy.

#### Developers

The choice for most people you want to invite to your ARC. Developers have **read and write access**, but cannot maintain the project on the DataHUB, e.g. inviting others.

#### Maintainers

Gives the person the same rights as you have (except of removing you from your own project). This is recommended for inviting PIs or group leaders allowing them to add their group members for data upload or analysis to the project as well.

*A detailed list of all permissions for the individual roles can be found [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html)*
