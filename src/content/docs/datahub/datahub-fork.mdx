:::note[About this guide]
The DataHUB allows to "fork" an ARC. This creates an exact copy of an ARC under a different user or group account while staying connected to the original ARC.

<Steps>

1. Navigate to the ARC that you would like to fork and click "Fork" in the top-right corner (1).

2. In the fork menu you can
   
    - adapt the name (1) of the ARC (your fork),
    - select a namespace (2), i.e. your user or a group name,
    - adapt the project slug (3)
    - select which branches to fork (4)

    :::tip
    Note that these options change the display name and URL of your fork of the ARC. The original ARC stays unchanged.
    :::

    :::tip
    The visibility level (5) and access permissions are inherited from the original ARC.

3. Once forked, you can work on your fork

    - In the ARC panel you can see the adapted name that you chose for the ARC (1). 
    - You can recognize that this is a forked ARC and navigate to the original source (2).
