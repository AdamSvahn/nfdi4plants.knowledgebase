Working with user groups helps to organize multiple ARCs for your lab or consortium. 
You can create a new group from the [groups panel](datahub-groupsPanel.html).

To create group,

1. choose a suitable name (1),
2. adapt the url if needed (2),
3. set the visibility level (3), and 
4. invite members with a specified role and permission (4).

:::tip
When syncing an ARC shared with a group, the group's url rather than your user url is used to generate the ARC's address.
