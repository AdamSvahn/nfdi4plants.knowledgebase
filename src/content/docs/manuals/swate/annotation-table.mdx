## Open or create an assay or study file

To create an annotation table file with the [Swate standalone](https://swate-alpha.nfdi4plants.org/) in your browser, click "New File" and select which kind of file (investigation, study, assay) you want to create. If you already created a `isa.study.xlsx` or `isa.assay.xlsx` file, you can select "Import File" to modify and add to it.

In the "Metadata" sheet, you can fill in general metadata about your investigation, study or assay.

## Add an annotation table

In the "New Table" sheet, you can create your annotation table by adding [building blocks](../building-blocks). Your annotation table should consist of an "Input", multiple descriptive building blocks ("Characteristics", "Parameters", "Components") and an "Output".

To create an annotation table within ARCitect, add a new table to your assay or study by clicking the plus (+) symbol next to your metadata sheet. Here, you can build your annotation table by adding [building blocks](../building-blocks) the same way as in the Swate standalone.
