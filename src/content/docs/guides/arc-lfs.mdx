Here we explain how to handle large data files in your ARC.
{/* 
:::note[About this guide]
In this guide we show you how you can actively handle large data files in your ARC using **[ARC Commander](/arc-commander)**.
:::

:::tip[Before we can start]
- You have created an ARC before using the [ARCitect](/arcitect) or [ARC Commander](/arc-commander)  
- You have a [DataPLANT](https://register.nfdi4plants.org) account  
- Your computer is linked to the [DataHUB](https://git.nfdi4plants.org) via personal access token

## Large File Storage (LFS)

ARCs and the DataHUB come with a mechanism to sync and store large files called *Large File Storage (LFS)*. LFS is an efficient way to store your large data files. These files are called "LFS objects". Rather than checking every file during every `arc sync` (ARC Commander) or DataHUB Sync (ARCitect), the tools first check *whether there was a change at all*. And only if this is the case, it scans *what* was changed. This way it saves time and computing power compared to always scanning all large files for possible changes.


### ARCitect

import ARCitectLFS from '../arcitect/arcitect-lfs.mdx'

<ARCitectLFS />

### ARC Commander

import ARCCommanderLFS from '../arc-commander/lfs.mdx'

<ARCCommanderLFS />


### DataHUB 

import DataHUBLFS from '../datahub/datahub-lfs.mdx'

<DataHUBLFS />
