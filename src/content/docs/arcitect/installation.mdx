## Install ARCitect via installer

<Steps>

1. Head to the ARCitect's GitHub <a href="https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARCitect/releases/latest" target="_blank">release page</a>.
2. Download the Linux AppImage ARCitect-x.x.x.AppImage
3. (optional) If you run Ubuntu 22.04 you need to download an additional library. Ubuntu 22.04 can't run AppImage files without the not natively installed FUSE library. To fix this, install the necessary library. To do this you need root permissions.

    ```bash title="Requires root permission"
    sudo apt install libfuse2
    ```

</Steps>

## Make the ARCitect executable

You need to make the downloaded AppImage executable before you can run it.
You can use the user interface or the command line to do this.

## User interface


<Steps>
1. open the folder where the AppImage is currently saved (likely in Downloads)
2. (optional) move the file to a location where you want it saved
3. right-click the file and select properties

    ![](@images/arcitect/linux-rightclick.png)

4. go to the "permissions" tab and tick the field "execute"

    ![](@images/arcitect/linux-permissions.png)

5. now double-clicking the AppImage should start the ARCitect

    ![](@images/arcitect/linux-checkbox.png)

</Steps>

## Command line

<Steps>

1. open a terminal
2. move to the directory where you have saved your AppImage (e.g. Downloads)

    ```bash
    cd Downloads
    ```

3. Make the file executable (use the appropriate name of the file)

    ```bash
    chmod u+x ARCitect-x.x.x.AppImage
    ```

4. Now double-clicking the AppImage or running the following command (with the appropriate file name) should start the ARCitect

    ```bash
    ./ARCitect-x.x.x.AppImage
    ```
