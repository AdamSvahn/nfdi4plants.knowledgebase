    For Linux we recommend to install via homebrew as described on the site above.
    :::

<Steps>

1. Head to the ARCitect's GitHub <a href="https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARCitect/releases/latest" target="_blank">release page</a>.
2. Download the Linux AppImage ARCitect-x.x.x.AppImage
3. (optional) If you run Ubuntu 22.04 you need to download an additional library. Ubuntu 22.04 can't run AppImage files without the not natively installed FUSE library. To fix this, install the necessary library. To do this you need root permissions.

    ```bash title="Requires root permission"
    sudo apt install libfuse2
    ```

4. Make the ARCitect executable

    You need to make the downloaded AppImage executable before you can run it.
    You can use the user interface or the command line to do this.
