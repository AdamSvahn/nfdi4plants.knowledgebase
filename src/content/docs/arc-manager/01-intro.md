The ARCmanager is a web service that allows DataPLANT users to create and modify ARCs in a web browser environment. Edits done with the ARCmanager will be directly applied to the copy of your ARC on the respective DataHUB.

While the [ARC Commander](./../ArcCommanderManual/index.html) provides a command line interface (CLI) to create and modify ARCs, and the [ARCitect](./../ARCitect-Manual/index.html) is a desktop application to perform similar tasks with a graphical user interface (GUI), the ARCmanager provides a web interface for editing ARCs without the necessity to install any software on your computer.
