[elab2ARC](http://nfdi4plants.org/elab2arc) is a tool for converting eLabFTW experiments into ARC format. It allows researchers to easily fetch experiment data from eLabFTW instances and update or push these files to DataHUB in ARC format. The application streamlines the management of data from lab experiments to repositories, improving efficiency in scientific data handling.


## Why is elab2ARC needed?
Many researchers use electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) to document their experiments. However, transferring metadata from ELNs to ARCs manually can be error-prone and time-consuming. elab2ARC addresses this gap by providing a streamlined method to extract, transform, and load data directly from ELN records into an ARC-compliant structure.

## Feature of elab2ARC

## Setting up elab2ARC

:::note
At the moment you can only use the tool on the eLabFTW Demo or eLabFTW HHU Instance.
:::


### Create an access token in DataHUB

import DataHubPat from '../datahub/navigation-settings/datahub-generate-project-acces-tokendatahub-generate-pat.mdx'

### Create an eLabFTW API key

<Steps>
1. Login to your elabFTW instance 
2. Navigate to 'User Settings'

3. Navigate to 'API KEYS' Tab. Enter a name and a **Read Only** permissions

4. Copy key somewhere, because it will only displayed ones

</Steps>

### Modify eLabFTW experiment


<Steps>
1. Select the eLabFTW experiment, which you want to convert and go to edit mode
2. Add an extra field to your eLabFTW experiment (bottom)

3. Use field type **URL** and as a name **datahub_url** and enter the **URL of your ARC** as the default value

4. Save the entry

</Steps>

## How to use elab2ARC 

<Steps>
1. Select your elabFTW Instance [1]
2. Paste eLabFTW API key [2]
3. Paste DataHUB Project Access Token [3]
    ![](@images/images/guides/eLabFTW/elab2ARC-tool-usage.png)

4. Enter eLabFTW Experiment ID [4] (use comma to seperate multiple IDs) which can be found in the experiment settings. Make sure that you have added the DataHUB URL as an extra field before.

5. Click **One Click Submission** [5] to start the converting. 

</Steps>

## Conversion 

The elab2ARC tool will automatically convert your elabFTW experiments into ARC format
- create a new assay folder with eLabFTW experiment name as assay name
- create the assay folder structure (dataset/protocols/isa.assay)
- convert experiment main text into a .md file and store it in the protocol folder
- add all attachments of the eLabFTW experiment into the dataset folder
- enter name/email/affiliation of the eLabFTW experiment metadata into the isa.assay sheet
