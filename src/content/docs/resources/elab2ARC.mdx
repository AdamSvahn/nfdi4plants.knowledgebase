[elab2ARC](http://nfdi4plants.org/elab2arc) is a tool for converting eLabFTW experiments into ARC format. It allows researchers to easily fetch experiment data from eLabFTW instances and update or push these files to DataHUB in ARC format. The application streamlines the management of data from lab experiments to repositories, improving efficiency in scientific data handling.


## Why is elab2ARC needed?
Many researchers use ELNs to document their experiments. However, transferring metadata from ELNs to ARCs manually can be error-prone and time-consuming. elab2ARC addresses this gap by providing a streamlined method to extract, transform, and load data directly from ELN records into an ARC-compliant structure.

## Setting up elab2ARC

:::note
At the moment you can only use the tool on the eLabFTW Demo or eLabFTW HHU Instance.
:::


### Create an access token in DataHUB

import DataHubPat from '../datahub/navigation-settings/datahub-generate-project-acces-tokendatahub-generate-pat.mdx'

### Create an eLabFTW API key

<Steps>
1. Login to your elabFTW instance 
2. Navigate to "User Settings". Head to the ARCitect's GitHub [release page](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARCitect/releases/latest).
2. Under "Assets" Download the latest release for Windows (`ARCitect-x.x.x-win.zip`).
3. In Windows Explorer, open the folder where you downloaded the ARCitect.
4. Unzip (`Right click` âžž `Extract All..`) the folder (`ARCitect-x.x.x-win.zip`). You can move this folder to another location (e.g. `Program files`).
5. Start the ARCitect, by clicking the `ARCitect` application.

6. Once started, you see a Windows Defender warning. To proceed, click `More info` and then `Run anyway`.

7. Windows Defender Firewall further asks you to allow network communication. This enables communication with the [DataHUB](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/datahub).
