:::note[About this guide]
In this guide we introduce how to access ARCs from Galaxy. To access the data of an ARC, you must first provide a DataHUB access token in Galaxy, which is used to authenticate Galaxy to DataHUB. To create a new token and add it to [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.eu/), you can proceed as described below.
:::

:::tip[Before we can start]
- You have created an ARC before using the [ARC Commander](./../implementation/ArcCommander.html) or [ARCitect](./../ARCitect-Manual/index.html)  
- You have a [DataPLANT](https://register.nfdi4plants.org) account
:::

## Create an access token in DataHUB

<Steps>

1. Open the dropdown menu for your personal settings.
2. Open the "Preferences" menu.
3. Change to tab "Access Tokens".
4. Choose a name for the new token.
5. Set a expiration date.
6. Select the authorization scope. 

</Steps>

:::tip
Only the scopes "api" (for write access) and "read_api" (for read access) are relevant for ARCfs.
:::

:::caution
After you crated the token, you can copy and view it. After you leave the site, you will **not** be able to do so again.

## Add the token to Galaxy

<Steps>

1. Visit [usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu/) and log in or create an account. It is possible to log in using your DataPlant account.
2. Open the "User" drop down menu and
3. select "Preferences".
4. In the user preference settings, select "Manage Information".
5. Copy your token into the "API read access token" field. This filed is located at the bottom of the "User preferences" menu. Click "Save" to adopt your changes.

</Steps>

:::tip
Despite the name "API **read** access token", tokens with write access rights (like those with the scope "api") will also work or, respectively, are required.

## Data import

With the token available to Galaxy, you are now able to import data. You can do this as described below.

2. Pick "Choose remote files".
3. Scroll down and select "DataPLANT DataHub ARRCs".
4. Explore ARCs or
5. search for a specific one.
6. Inside an ARC, choose the file you want to import to Galaxy. Confirm with "Ok".
7. Click start to begin the import process to Galaxy. This may take some time, depending
   on the workload on the Galaxy server and the size of your file.

</Steps>

## Data export

It is also possible to export datasets back to an ARC. You can do this as described below.
