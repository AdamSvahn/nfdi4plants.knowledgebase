After the setup steps, you're all set and ready to start using the ARC Commander. 

- For all following steps it is assumed, that you opened a shell or command prompt within a directory you want to initiate as an ARC
- Note that each input that contains non-literal characters must be encapsulated in quotation marks when entered within the shell. This also applies when using the editor for numerals that are no numbers (dates, phone numbers, etc.).
- Furthermore, `arc` defines the path to the ARC Commander executable (e.g. on Windows "C:\Users\userA\programs\ArcCommander\arc.exe").
- Every input can be entered by using the shell. For user friendly experience, an editor may pop up if no arguments are given. After entering the required values, save and close the editor.

> :warning: Note: We strongly recommend to read the in-depth guides to the ARC Commander on the following pages!
