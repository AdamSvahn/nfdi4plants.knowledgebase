## 🌐 ARC - Annotated Research Context

DataPLANT provides with the Annotated Research Context (ARC) an Research Data Management (RDM) platform after the FAIR principle. The CMML  implements the ARC for cooperations. The aim is to exchange samplesheets, workflows, protocols and share (meta-)data inside a common and shareable folder structure.

:bulb: For more information about ARC click [here](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/docs/implementation/AnnotatedResearchContext.html).

The previously created ARC will be shared with you over the [DataHUB platform](https://git.nfdi4plants.org/). Please read the following setup and complete the next steps.
