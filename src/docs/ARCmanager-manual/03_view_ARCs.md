## Viewing ARCs

For the sake of simplicity, we are here using the term "ARC" for (DataHUB) "Project", because the DataHUB does not make any distinction between Projects that have the ARC folder and file structure and those that have not. Both are initially shown in the ARCmanager, but the ARCmanager has not been created for manipulating Projects which are not ARCs. These are better viewed and modified in the DataHUB directly. 

The ARCmanager is for viewing and manipulating ARCs.

Once you are logged in, you have got several options for selecting which ARCs (Projects) to view (Fig. 1):

    </p>
    </br>

1. By pressing the button "Load ARCS" you are offered a list of all ARCs (Projects) of the DataHUB you have got the rights to view. These are the ARCs (Projects) that are either public, public within the DataHub, or of which you are a member. ARCs (Projects) owned by you are highlighted in colour.

2. By ticking the box "Your ARCs". This restricts the list to the ARCs(Projects) in which you are member. Again, ARCs owned by you are highlighted in colour.

By default, the ARCs (Project) are sorted by the timing of the last changes, in descending order from latest to earliest.

On the right hand side of each ARC (Project) in the list, there are two buttons:

- the lense button (Fig. xxxx) which takes you to the ARC (Project) on the DataHUB page.

- the downward arrow button (Fig.) which expands the ARC (Project) within the ARCmanager.

### Viewing the ARC (Project) contents

Once you have expanded the ARC (Project) you will get a list of files and folders that are included in the ARC. 

Clicking anywhere in the header row (Fig. xxx) will hide this list.


If you are selecting a file that can be read by ARCmanager (.xlsx, any kind of text file including e.g. .md), the content of the file can be displayed within the ARCmanager.

- for text files, upon clicking on the file name, the contents of the file can be viewed and edited in the panel to the right.
- the administrative page of of isa formatted .xlsx files, upon clicking on the file name, the contents can be viewed and edited in the  panel to the right

If no readable file is selected, the button xxx (Fig. xxx) will display the list of changes of the ARC (Project) if this option is ticked.

Fig. xxxx, the button xxx will open a panel on the right. If now i

By ticking the box "View changes" a list of all changes to the project is displayed.

### Searching for ARCs

Without logging onto any DataHub, the ARC search button (Fig. 1) provides a list of published ARCs that can be searched using the ISA Metadata Search via the [ARC Metadata Registry](https://arc-metadata-registry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a service under construction.

Different viewing and searching options come into play for unpublished ARCs.

Once a list of ARCs (Projects) is displayed in the ARCmanager (see Fig. xxx), by searching for words or - terms, the displayed list is reduced to only include ARCs (Projects) with names, descriptions or author descriptions containing the search term(s). If your list spans more than a single page, be aware that the search will only find what is on the current page.
