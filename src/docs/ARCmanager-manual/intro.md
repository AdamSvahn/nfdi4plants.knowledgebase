The ARCmanager is a web service that allows DataPLANT users to create and modify ARCs in a web browser environment. Edits done with the ARCmanager will be directly applied to the copy of your ARC on the respective DataHUB.

While the [ARC Commander](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/docs/ArcCommanderManual/index.html) provides a command line interface (CLI) to create and modify ARCs, and the [ARCitect](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/docs/ARCitect-Manual/index.html) is a desktop application to perform similar tasks with a graphical user interface (GUI), the ARCmanager provides an easily accessible web interface. 

The primary purpose of the ARCmanager is to create new ARCs and edit existing ones. A particular focus is on the administrative metadata associated with ARCs, but we are currently exploring solutions to provide the function to upload large experimental datasets as well. In the mean time large data files are best uploaded by using one of the other two aforementioned services.
