# Logging in

To be able to use the [ARCmanager](https://nfdi4plants.de/arcmanager/app/index.html), you need to have registered to one of the DataHUBs. Information on the different DataHUBss can be found on https://www.nfdi4plants.de/content/datahub.html.

Pressing the the 'DataHUB' button (Fig. 1) brings you to the drop down menu of available DataHubs. The currently selected DataHUB is shaded in grey (Fig. 2).

At present, there are three different DataHUBs available for managing research data. The DataHUBs "reference" and "federated" are available to all researchers, whereas the TRR356 PlantMicrobe has been created for the selfsame transregio project. Members of the TRR356 project are adivsed to use this DataHUB. Collaborators of TRR356 research are welcome to the TRR356 PlantMicrobe DataHUB and will be admitted upon request to (**whose email?**).

If you are using the ARCmanager for the first time, you will see a window (Fig. 4) asking you to authorize the ARCmanager to use your account. Use the red "Authorize" button to proceed.

For the login process, you are presented with a selection of login option. Select one that you have used before in the registration process and enter your credentials. 
    
    Different login option can be used for the same DataHUB user, if the logins of the different providers have been merged. This process is mediated by Life Science RI. If are not presented with the option to merge your identities during the registration of an additional identity via another provider, you will have to get in touch with support@aai.lifescience-ri.eu for merging the identities. "Unmerged" identities will be treated as two different users in the DataHUB. Having different users complicates working with GitLab projects locally on your computer and is not recommended.

![\src\docs\ARCmanager-manual\img\01-login\src\docs\ARCmanager-manual\img\01-login_3.png](Fig. 5 Login options.)

After successful login, you see the former lilac Login button change to a pink Logout button (Fig. 6).

![\src\docs\ARCmanager-manual\img\01-login\src\docs\ARCmanager-manual\img\01-login_4.png](Fig. 6 Welcome screen after login. The presence of the pink Logout button (arrow) is a useful indicator for showing that you are logged in.)

Once you are logged in, the green "Load ARCS" button (Fig. 6, 1) gives you a list of all projects (ARCs or other GitLab projects) of the DataHUB that are visible to you, with the projects in your namespace highlighted in yellow. 

Ticking "Your Arcs" (Fig. 6, 2) will return only the projects/ARCs from your own namespace.

The search window (Fig. 6, 3) allows you to search for expressions in project/ARC names.
