Welcome to the ARCmanager manual!

Here, you can find detailed information about the ARCmanager web service.

For further details, please visit our sub pages:

1. [What is the ARCmanager?](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/docs/ARCmanager-manual/intro.html)

## What is the ARCmanager?

The ARCmanager is a web service that allows DataPLANT users to create and modify ARCs in a web browser environment. Edits done with the ARCmanager will be directly applied to the copy of your ARC on the respective DataHUB.

The primary purpose of the ARCmanager is to create new ARCs and edit existing ones. A particular focus is on the administrative metadata associated with ARCs, but we are currently exploring solutions to provide the function to upload large experimental datasets as well.

:bulb: IMPORTANT NOTE

The ARCmanager web service is currently in development. The service can be unavailable for short time periods and unintended behavior of the service can occur. We are constantly working on improving the service and appreciate any bug reports and constructive feedback.

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions how to improve the service, please consider opening a new issue in one of the project related github repositories:
