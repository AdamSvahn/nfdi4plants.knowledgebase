ðŸš§ The ARCitect is currently being developed and not completely user-ready, yet. Installation for beta-testing requires an admin account.

1. Head to the ARCitect's GitHub [release page](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARCitect/releases/latest). 
2. Under "Assets" Download the latest release for Windows (`ARCitect-x.x.x-win.zip`).
3. In Windows Explorer, open the folder where you downloaded the ARCitect
4. Unzip (`Right click` âžž `Extract All..`) the folder (`ARCitect-x.x.x-win.zip`). You can move this folder to another location (e.g. `Program files`).
5. Start the ARCitect, by clicking the `ARCitect` executable.
