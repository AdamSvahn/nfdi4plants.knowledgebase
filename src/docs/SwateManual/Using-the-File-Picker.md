You might to add file names to a column. Since typing in name by name could get quite tedious, you can add the file names with the file picker instead. Click on 'Pick file names', choose the files which names you want to insert, and then copy them to your clipboard with the button on the left to paste them where you like to â€“ or click on 'Insert File Names' to directly paste them into the selected cells. You can also sort the file names (anti-)alphabetically with the respective buttons on the right.
