Building Blocks are necessary to sustain ontology information in an [annotation table](./Docs02-Annotation-Table.html) and are designed to follow the core idea behind the [ISA-Tab](https://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isatab.html) format, although simplified. For more details, please check out the [Building Block Types](./swate_blocks_types.html).

<!-- Any Swate annotation table can be converted to ISA-Json. -->

## Usage in Swate

1. Navigate to the *Building Blocks* tab in the <a href="./../img/Swate-Overlay-Exp.jpg" target="_blank">navbar</a>.
2. This tab offers two functions, which allow you to
   1. [add a new](./swate_blocks_add.html) building block or
   2. [add units](./swate_blocks_units.html) to building blocks.
