We offer different routes of installing Swate.

:warning: Please note that we cannot guarantee compatibility of Swate with Excel versions that are *not* part of MS 365.

## Browser Installation

If you want to jump right into Swate and start testing the environment and features without much fuzz, we recommend using [Swate in your Browser](./swate_installation_browser.html). This method uses the web version of [Microsoft Excel](https://www.office.com/) which can be used for free with a free Microsoft account.

This installation should work smoothly with all operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and browsers.

On macOS, some features are only available with the browser [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/).

## Desktop Installation

To most easily annotate data in the ARC stored on your computer, we recommend installing the [Swate plugin in your Excel desktop application](./swate_installation_desktop.html). This allows you to open the relevant isa.assay.xlsx or isa.study.xlsx workbook for Swate annotation directly from your ARC.
