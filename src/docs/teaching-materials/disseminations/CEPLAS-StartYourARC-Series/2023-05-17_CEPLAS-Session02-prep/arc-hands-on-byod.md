# Bring your own data

For the hands-on session, please bring data, to start creating an ARC together.


So please bring some data of your own project.

You can bring data of your current research, which 

Especially in the beginning phase, it might make sense to package an already published dataset.

- to showcase your ARC in your group
- to easily get our help on your data
