# The ARC Club

a two-day adventure to get your lab into the ARC universe

## The goal

- Data ingest
- Only the first few steps into ARCs


<!--  TODO -->

Draw image: lift project over the line: below / above : with / without ARC.
Above line => Autobahn / Rocket / project liftin off (into a good future)

Starting point



## The Rules

You do not talk about **ARC Club**

## The Rules: Perfect is the enemy of good

- There is no perfect ARC
- There is no complete ARC
- The only bad ARCs are those that don't exist yet.


## The Game

- More ARCs 


## The Setting

- good internet connection
- isolated from lab // office // daily
- access to the data to be ARCified (file share, hard disks)
- agile, communicative, positive

## Schedule



## Preparation

- datahub user accounts
- datahub user group
- list of projects


## "easy" catches

- published data
- why even ARC them?


## more challanging ARCs

- (unpublished) left-overs of colleagues who have since moved


## incentive

- you've needed data before, now is your chance to make data available
- 

## perspective

- appreciate change


## Volunteers

- coders
- data handlers
- people who have been around for a long time
