# Part 2: ARCing


## Step 0: Assign yourself to the project

## Step 1: Collect / derive as much info about the investigation as possible. <!-- fit -->


**MUST** haves

```yaml
Investigation Identifier
Investigation Title
...
Investigation Publication Status
...
Investigation Person Last Name
Investigation Person First Name


```

:bulb: This and more investigation-level info can be collected in the ARC's `isa.investigation.xlsx`


## Step 2: Create and share the ARC

```bash
arc init
arc sync -f -r https://git.nfdi4plants.org/hhu-plant-biochemistry/<InvestigationID>
```

:warning: 


## Step 3: Copy data

:warning: Do not **move** data from original source

```
scp 
```






<!-- 
## "easy" catches

- published data
- why even ARC them?


## more challenging ARCs

- (unpublished) left-overs of colleagues who have since moved



## perspective

- This is just a start
- Appreciate change
