# Create your own ARC

Recommended first steps to your ARC

## Sketch your ARC

Try to draw a little map of what your project could look like as an ARC

## Create a new ARC

- Create a new ARC on your computer using ARCitect or ARC commander
- Upload the ARC to the DataHUB

## Add README.md

- The README.md is the first thing everyone sees when opening your ARC in the DataHUB
- This is an easy-to-use place for notes or info about your ARC
- You could add your sketch / map here

## Add a `LICENSE` file to the ARC

Adding a license is easy via the DataHUB:
  
  1. Go to the ARC
  2. Click the button "Add LICENSE"
  3. Apply a license template
  4. Commit the changes

:bulb: There is no template for CC-BY 4.0. You can add the license text from https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/.


## Add metadata to ISA Investigation

- [ ] Add a **Title**: e.g. the project or publication title
- [ ] Add a **Description**: e.g. the project description or  publication abstract
- [ ] Add **Contacts**: e.g. collaborators or publication authors
  1. Add First Name, Last Name, Affiliation
  2. Add ORCID
- [ ] Add Publication(s)
  1. DOI, Title, Authors, Status = Published

## Add assay data

The publication may contain a section ""data availability"" or ""data accession"" or similar that references external links (typically a large data repository).

Try to find and transfer info (sample accessions, IDs, metadata, links, etc.) into the ARC. This would typically be an assay.
"

## File names

- Avoid spaces in file names. We recommend to use camelCase or PascalCase for file names
- However, in order to keep track of links and data origin, it is recommended to keep the original name of data files (i.e. if a publisher or repository stores files with spaces).

## Add Study high-level metadata

- [ ] if the study is internal (i.e. a dataset from **this** publication)
  - Think of a suitable study identifier and title
  - Transfer only the people from investigation-level to study
  - Description: write a short summary / bullet points, e.g. if the study describes the growth of plant samples, summarize sample types, treatments (no need to repeat full protocols)

- [ ] if the study is external (i.e. a dataset from **another** publication)
  - Add Title: publication title
  - Add Description: publication abstract
  - Add Public Release Date: publication online date
  - Add People: authors in same order as on publication
  - Add Publication(s): DOI, Title, Authors, Status = Published
"

8. Add Assay high-level metadata,"
- [ ] add Measurement Type, Technology Type, Technology Platform for every assay (ideally backed by ontology terms)
- [ ] if applicable, add people (assay performers)
"

9. Annotate ISA studies and assays,"
Describe the sample-to-data flow using ISA

- [ ] the `./assays/<assayName>/isa.assay.xlsx` should relate to the ./assays/<assayName>/protocols
  - Add a sheet with the same name as the file for each protocol file; e.g. `./assays/<assayName>/protocols/plant-growth.md` --> `./assays/<assayName>/isa.assay.xlsx:plant-growth.md`
  - Link the protocol file name (e.g. `plant-growth.md`) in the respective `Protocol REF` column

- [ ] all files stored in a folder `./assays/<assayName>/dataset` should be linked in an Output building block of the `./assays/<assayName>/isa.assay.xlsx`
  - Use `Output [Raw Data File]` to link raw data generated by a machine, measuring device, etc.
  - Use `Output [Derived Data File]` to link data produced by a computational workflow, script, software
  - :bulb: Note that an assay can produce
    - samples from samples: e.g. `Input [Sample Name]` leaf samples -> `Output [Sample Name]` RNA extract samples
    - data from samples: e.g. `Input [Sample Name]` cDNA libraries -> `Output [Raw Data File]` qRT-PCR results
    - data from data: e.g. `Input [Raw Data File]` qRT-PCR results -> `Output [Derived Data File]` Plot of relative gene expression

- [ ] use Sample/Material/Data nodes (Input [ ] / Output[ ]) ... 
  - ... to link between processes (sheets) **within** one study/assay
  - ... to link **across** multiple studies and / or assays

The final result (across all isa.*.xlsx sheets) should be a gapless connection from `isa.study.xlsx`-sheets through `isa.assay.xlsx`-sheets representing the flow through the various Input/Output nodes of sample/material --> through processes/protocols --> to Input/Output nodes of sample/material/raw data/derived data.
So that any file stored in a `./assays/<assayName>/dataset` can be traced back along the chain of processes to the original sample in the lab.
