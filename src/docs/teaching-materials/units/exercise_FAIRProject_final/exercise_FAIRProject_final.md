# Understand your colleague’s ARC

1. Go to your colleague’s ARC
2. Try to identify one experiment that led to results (e.g. a figure in the thesis)
3. What are the samples (e.g. plants, bacteria)?
4. How were the samples prepared (~ materials)?  
5. How was the experiment performed (~ methods)?
6. What is the raw data (~ results)?
7. How was the data analyzed (~ computational methods, statistics)?  
8. Collect all of the above in a `README_<YourArbitraryParticipantID>.md` in the same folder.
