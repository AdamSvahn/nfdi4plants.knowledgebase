Building Blocks are necessary to sustain ontology information in an [annotation table](./Docs02-Annotation-Table.html) and are designed to follow the core idea behind the [ISA-Tab](https://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isatab.html) format, although simplified. Any Swate annotation table can be converted to ISA-Json.


## Usage

1. Navigate to the *Building Blocks* tab in the <a href="./../../img/Swate-Overlay-Exp.jpg" target="_blank">navbar</a>.
2. This page shows two functions, one to add new building blocks and one to update existing building blocks with a unit.
