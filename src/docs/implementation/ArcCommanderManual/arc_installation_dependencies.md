An installation of [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is mandatory for ARC Commander usage. Whenever submitting a command that relies on a git functionality, the ARC Commander will check for presence of git and git LFS. If not installed, the respective command will result in an error. Throughout the installation setup of git, the user has the possibility to install git LFS. Git LFS can also be downloaded manually [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
