## 2.1 DataHUB access
In case you are not a member of DataPLANT yet, please [sign up](<https://register.nfdi4plants.org>). Afterwards, you will be granted access to DataPLANTâ€™s [DataHUB](<https://git.nfdi4plants.org>). The DataHUB allows you to share your ARCs with registered lab or project partners.

After successful registration, create and set an access token for ARC Commander synchronization using

```bash
arc remote accesstoken get -s https://git.nfdi4plants.org
```

A window within your browser will open, asking for your DataPLANT Log In. In case you are already logged in, the browser will directly display a Success message to you.
