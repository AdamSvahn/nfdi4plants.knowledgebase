## About this guide

In this guide we collect recommendations and thoughts on creating an ARC based on a publication and associated published datasets.
This is not the typical entry into an ARC, but rather retrospective. It might however help to build community-tailored showcases; i.e. showing what a project could look like as an ARC.
