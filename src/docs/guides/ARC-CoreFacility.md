## About this guide

In this guide we explore how the ARC can help streamline data flows and project management in a core facility.

:warning:
This guide presents an interim solution. We are working on a more user-friendly implementation.

## Before we can start

## Core facilities

- centers that focus on a specific set of methods to routinely measure biological samples
- examples are core facilities for omics technologies and imaging

## Project initiation

Most core facilities have a more or less established routine for submission of samples to be assayed
This includes a ping-pong of meetings to find out
  - what is the biological question, what does the researcher want to find out, what is the most suitable method
  - how do the samples need to be prepared and submitted
  - what data 

During this time a lot of metadata is exchanged
  - meeting minutes could be attached to the ARC's wiki

- typically 


## templates for sample submission 

- Use templates
  - user-targeted templates
  - templates for your routine measurements can be stored as a reusable JSON file
- metadata in

- assay data out



## routine computational workflows

- the ARC model and 

- quality control
  - within one ARC
  - across ARCs covering routine measurements


## What about non-plant-scientist / non-ARC users 

- the DataHUB comes with built-in, intuitive features 
- users only need access


- you decide wether you meet the researchers half the way, let them initiate the ARC or

who initiates the ARC
  - researcher 


## Benefits for the researcher

- already described investigation (and study) for another facility, would not want to double the work for another assay
-
