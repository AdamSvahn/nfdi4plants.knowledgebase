# Creating slides from Markdown

## VS code extension

- Marp for VS Code https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode

- View result:
  - either VS code preview (cmd + k, v) or
  - or via command `Marp: Export Slide Deck` (to PDF)

## Adapt markdown files

1. To YAML, add `marp: true`
1. Add `----` (horizontal lines) as slide breaks
    1. will of course be rendered as horizontal lines in other outputs...
